# To Do

## UI

### Job build card

### FFLogs card

<!-- * Only show jobs within the role -->
* Fix URL validation 

### Rotation DPS distribution card

* Mobile friendly graph/table

### Action DPS distributions

* Selector for which actions to display
* x-axis slider with dynamic y-axis scaling
    * better y-axis scaling
    * Partial property callback
* Switch mean to 50%
* Maybe show sigma or IQR? 

## Backend

### Buffs/actions by ID

### Data

* move leftover dmg_distribution to damage_analysis.py
    * Probably switch mean to 50%
    * I think I can also not have to use numerical integration...
* Start planning potency table management.
